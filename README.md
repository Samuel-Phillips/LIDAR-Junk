# LIDAR-Junk

Note that data is required for this stuff to work. Currently, scripts take
the file to operate upon as their argument. I'm running it on some Loudoun
County, VA data; but the man don't make downloading it easy, so use whatever
strikes your fancy.

If you really want it go [here][http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/], create an
account and search for the specific data set `VA_LOUDOUNCO_2012_000298`.
